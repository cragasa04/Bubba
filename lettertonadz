Hi Mahal,
Long distance is worth it. You are worth it.
I thank everyone and every hardship that brought me to you.
With every day that passes my you are the the only heart mine beats for.

Les longues distances en valent la peine. Vous le valez bien.
Je remercie tout le monde et toutes les difficultés qui m'ont amené à vous.
Avec chaque jour qui passe, tu es le seul cœur pour lequel je bats.

If the whole world was watching I would still dance with you.

I wanted to remind you I'm in

You serenade my heart with a simple smile.

I love how gently you hold me and the way you comb my hair. I love how your eyes sparkle and way your presence calms me.


You're everything i didn't think i deserved.
